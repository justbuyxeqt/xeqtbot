# XEQTBot

## What is this?

The source code for [/u/XEQTbot](https://www.reddit.com/user/XEQTbot/)

## Why?

People always ask the same questions on [/r/JustBuyXEQT](https://www.reddit.com/r/JustBuyXEQT). I got tired of giving the same answers so I made a bot that can be triggered to post the answers to save myself and other some time.

## How?

Simply tag /u/XEQTbot with the appropriate trigger word and he will show up.
