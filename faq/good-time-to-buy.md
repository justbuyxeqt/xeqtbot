### Is now a good time to buy?

**tl;dr: Nobody knows. But most likely yes.**

**Nobody can predict market dips:** Not you, not me, not the experts who spend their day actively managing funds. The best time to invest was yesterday, the second-best time is today. There is a good chance the price continues to rise while you wait for a dip, and by the time a correction finally comes, it dips down to a price that's higher than today's.

**Time in the market beats timing the market:** XEQT is a solid, diversified ETF that holds the entire global stock market. Over the long run (15+ years), these short-term price movements become noise. What matters is getting your money working for you as soon as possible.

**Consistency is key:** Instead of trying to find the "perfect" moment, focus on regular investing. Decide on your investment budget, then set up automatic purchases monthly or bi-weekly, regardless of whether the market is up or down. This set-and-forget approach will naturally smooths out market volatility over time.

**Don't overthink it:** XEQT gives you instant global diversification across thousands of companies. You're not picking individual stocks or trying to outsmart the market. You're simply buying a piece of the entire world economy.
